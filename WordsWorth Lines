1. From "Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey":

"With tranquil restoration:—feelings too
Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man's life,
His little, nameless, unremembered acts
Of kindness and of love."

===================================================

2. From "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud":

"I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;"

"And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils."

===================================================

3. From "The World Is Too Much With Us":

"The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—
Little we see in Nature that is ours;"
